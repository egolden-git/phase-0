/*
    What is important to know when linking an external file (like a stylesheet) to an HTML file? The location of the file.
    What tricks did you use to help you with positioning? I used trial and error to get the positioning correct. How hard was it to get the site as you wanted it? It was challenging trying to put all the elements in the correct place.
    What CSS did you use to modify the element style (like size, color, etc.)  (font-zize:); (display:); (color:)
    Did you modify the HTML to include classes or ids? If so, which did you choose and why? I used classes because most modifications were applied to multiple elements. If you didn't, how would you know which one to add to your HTML?
    When you compared your site to the actual code base, which do you think had cleaner code that followed best practices and why?  The actual site is cleaner because it was probably built by experienced professionals.
