    <h2> Git and Github</h2>
    <p>
      Git is a popular VCS that is used by quite a few developers, and is very useful for open source projects.  Git is software we download on our computers that allows us to make “save points” for our project.  It also allows copies to be made so that others can modify the project too.  Then they can all be merged into a whole.  To make this easier it is a good idea to use a someone else to host the project.  And that is where GitHub comes in.

      That in a very broad way is what I learned in camp this week.  Plus the code to make it work, and quite a bit about being a responsible programmer.  Thanks for your time.

    How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?  Elements are laid out based on tags within the html body.  Not sure what the order the browser uses.
    What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?  Sublime allows you to create templates or snippets to define default code sections that you always want to appear.
