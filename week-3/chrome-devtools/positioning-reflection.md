    How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements? Devtools helps by allowing adjustment of the page and showing results.
    How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS? By using the styles tab of each element.
    What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning?
        Absolute - Places element exactly where you define.
        Fixed - Position relative to the viewport of the browser.
        Static - Default positioning
        Relative - Position "relative to itself" - Adding positoning will move element from where it is.
     Which did you find easiest to use? There is still confusion as to usage of each one. Which was most difficult? They were are equal.
    What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?
        Margin - Clears an area around the element
        Padding - Clears area around content
        Border - Creates a line around content
    What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?) Love - there was a hugh learning curve around being able to position and change using CSS.  It was quite interseting and challenging at the same time.
