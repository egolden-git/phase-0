What does puts do? Puts will write on the screen whatever comes after the command.  Puts will also add a new line after writing to the screen.
What is an integer? What is a float?  An integer simply put is any whole number and a float is any number with a decimal point.
What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming? Float division will return float integers while integer division will return only integers.  Integer division will round the answers down to the nearest whole number.

```ruby-Hours in a year
hours = 24 * 365
puts hours
```
```ruby-Seconds in a decade
seconds = 60 * 60
hours=seconds*24
year=hours*365
decade=year*10
puts decade
```
How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?
  Addition - calculates the sum of 2 numbers
  Subtraction - calculates the difference of 2 numbers
  Multiplication - calculates the product of 2 numbers
  Division - calculates the quotient of 2 numbers
What is the difference between integers and floats? Integers are whole numbers while floats are decimal numbers.
What is the difference between integer and float division? Integer division will return a whole number rounded down, while float division will return a decimal number.
What are strings? Why and when would you use them? A string is an object which holds information to be used in a program. Strings are used when you want to assign alpha or numeric value to an object.
What are local variables? Why and when would you use them? Local variables are values assigned to objects which are defined by the programmer.  You would use local variables to assign an initial value to an object.
How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics? This challenge was interesting.  Doing the exercises was a little different as instructions did't seem very clear.
