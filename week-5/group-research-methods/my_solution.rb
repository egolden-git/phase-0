# Person 3
def my_array_sorting_method(array)
  array.sort {|word,digit| word.to_s <=> digit.to_s}
end

def my_hash_sorting_method(pets)
  pets.sort_by {|name,age| age}
end

# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
#In solution 1, I used the .sort method.  This method takes the input from the array and compares 2 items initiated bt the spaceship operator. The comparison looks for 1 of 3 returns; -1 if the item on the left is smaller; +1 if the item on the left is larger; 0 if item on left and right are equal.
#In solution 2, I used the .sort_by method.  This method takes the input from the hash and sorts in order of indicated value.  In my solution, the hash is sorted by age after passing each hash entry to parameters name and age.

# Release 1: Identify and describe the Ruby method you implemented. Teach your
# accountability group how to use the methods.
#
#
#


# Release 3: Reflect!
# What did you learn about researching and explaining your research to others?
