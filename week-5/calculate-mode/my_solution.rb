# 0. Pseudocode

# What is the input? an array of numbers or strings
# What is the output? an array of the element(s) with the most occurences or the entire array if occurences are equal
# What are the steps needed to solve the problem?
# Create a hash (hash)
#LOOP Through the array
# IF the element of the array  already exists as a key, add 1 to its value.
# ELSE Make a new key(element) with the value of 1.
# END Loop
#
#LOOP Through hash and find largest value and create array with key
# HASH.max values
# Create an array with key
# Output array

# 1. Initial Solution
def mode (array)
  hash = {}
  array.each do |e|
    if hash.include?(e)
      hash[e] += 1
    else
      hash[e] = 1
    end
  end
  # max_hash = hash.max_by {|e,v| v}
  max = hash.values.max
   hash.select! {|e,v| v == max}
  return hash.keys
end
