# 1.1 Think About Time
    Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about?    I learned about mindsets and habit forming ideas.
    What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0? Time Boxing leverages a defined amount of time to accomplish goals.  At the end of the time period, the work is evaluated to determine completion.  I could use this in Phase 0 to help create habits that will help me work more efficiently.
    How do you manage your time currently? Time currently is managed on a project basis.  Time to complete tasks is estimated and work hours are determined based on completion/status.
    Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?  It works but is not efficient.  This method creates long days when work is not complete (typically towards the end of deadlines).
    Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how? Employing these new ideas can be employed, but must be done regularly to create habits that will be repeated autonomously.
    What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management? My plan is to develop time habits and work on challenges with time set aside to focus on tasks at hand.

## 1.2 The Command Line
    What is a shell? What is "bash?" A shell is a command line interface (CLI) which allows users to interact with an OS.  BASH was created to replace the Bourne Shell; it is the most common shell currently being used.
    What was the most challenging for you in going through this material? The most challenging commands were 'popd' and 'pushd'.
    Were you able to successfully use all of the commands? YES
    In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know? -help; with this command, you can learn the syntax and usage of any command used by the shell.
    Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.
-pwd - Prints current working directory
-ls - Lists contents of a directory
-mv - Moves object to new location; typically used to rename objects
-cd - Change Directory
-../ - Used with CD to change up one directory
-touch - Create an empty file
-mkdir - Make a new directory
-less - Display contents of file 1 page at a time
-rmdir - Remove/Delete Directory
-rm - Remove file
-help - Show help information about available commands

### 1.4 Forking and Cloning
    If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be? Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one? Instructions: 1. Create repository from github.com; 2. Click 'Fork' from github.com; 3. Copy URL from github.com; 4. Run git clone from CLI and paste URL from github.com; Forking a repository creates a local copy or the repository on your local machine preserving the original repository on github.com.
    What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?  No struggles; I learned how to make and why to fork repositories from github.com
