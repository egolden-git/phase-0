# Reflection for My Web #1
    -Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository. https://github.com/egolden-git/egolden-git.github.io
    -Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person. 1. From github.com home page; Click the '+' sign on top right; 2 Select "New Repository"; 3. Enter information for repository; 4. Copy URL; 5. Run #>git clone <Repository URL>
    -Describe what open source means. Open source means that any software under these guidelines can be openly used by others to change/modify your source code to suit their needs.  In some cases, they will not have to list the original developer as an entity of what they are soing.
    -What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?  I have not had much experience with open source so I generally do not have an opinion about it.
    -Assess the importance of using licenses. Licenses ensures that the rightful owners of the technology are being recognized and compensated for their work. Licensing also helps ensure the integrity and intended use of the software.
    -What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with? The git process of cloning repositories to the local machine were solidified as well as the process to update and save files from the local node.
    Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it. No, I used the provided challenge information to complete.
