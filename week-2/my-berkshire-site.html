<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
  It was invigorating.  Nice to see the HTML components at work.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
  Semantic elements make the code more intuitive and readable.  As the course continues the element usage will also become more intuitive.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
  I followed previous pages created so formatting is the same as other pages.  When pages become more complex, formatting will be imperative.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
  HTML so seems simple and easy to manipulate.  Have not really run into anything bad yet.
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
  The tip is always not to reinvent the wheel.  With previous pages created, I simply copied my old pages and updated information where needed.
